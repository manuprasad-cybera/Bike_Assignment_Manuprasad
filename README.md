# Bike_Assignment_Manuprasad

## Problem statement: 
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Business Goal: 
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Technology Used: 
  - Python
  - Pandas library 
  - numpy library
  - seaborn library
  - matplotlib library
  - Io
  - sklearn
  - statsmodels

## Result: 
  - Can concentrate more on the summer and winter seasons, the months of August and September, the weekends, and workdays, as these have a positive impact on bike rentals.

  - It is evident that the springtime has a negative correlation with bike rentals and negative coefficients. So that we can raise the demand there, we can make certain deals.

  - With regard to the weathersit variable, mist + cloudy and light snow weather have negative coefficients. Indeed, we are able to make offers
